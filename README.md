This repository contains a project that I still want to develop as far as possible. As the name suggests, the [project's app](https://petshop-beta-testing.web.app/) contains the data of a fictional petshop that sales several products.

So far, with the app a common visitor can register as a user, login, and read the product list. The admin user can read the product list and add products.

Now I want to elaborate further and get the user to place an order and the admin to view the orders.

I built the app from scratch. I began in April this year (2022) knowing very little about React, after taking only one course in the fall of 2021, and nothing about Firebase. I based the original version on my final assignment (Aug 2022) that I built to finish my degree as full stack developer at Careeria, Porvoo (FIN).
