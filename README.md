This repository contains a project that I still want to develop as far as possible. As the name suggests, the [project's app](https://petshop-beta-testing.web.app/) contains the data of a fictional petshop that sales several products.

So far, with the app a common visitor can register as a user, login, and read the product list. The admin user can read the product list and add products.

Later on, I want to elaborate further and get the user to place an order and the admin to view the orders.

This is a public version of the one I submitted as part of a final assignment I built to finish my degree as a full stack developer at [Careeria](https://careeria.fi/) (Sept 2022).
